I am Chih-Yu Tsao, holding a master's degree in Curating from Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts London. I have two years of experience as a Curatorial Assistant at C Square Gallery, where my work encompassed artist scouting, exhibition planning, and art market trend analysis. I have applied curatorial skills to marketing planning, utilizing in-depth market analysis and innovative strategies to enhance the market impact of artworks. During my master’s studies, I focused on handling large amounts of archive, conducting detailed analyses, and developing diverse curatorial directions, creating new exhibition concepts from a creative perspective and turning them into actionable curatorial plans. I am currently seeking opportunities in marketing strategy or planning, aiming to apply my curatorial experience and skills to the marketing field, drive brand development, and achieve commercial goals.
