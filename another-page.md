## Credit
<br>
Collaborated with the art investment and curatorial organization Modern Form to curate the innovative Credit project. Focused on connecting non-traditional artists, whose work goes beyond painting and sculpture, with unconventional exhibition spaces. This project broke away from the typical white-cube gallery setting, offering new opportunities for artist exposure and expanding the possibilities for art display.
